CV Evaluation System - Project Report
By: John Doe

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project implements an AI-powered CV evaluation system that automatically assesses candidate resumes and project reports against job requirements. The system uses advanced natural language processing to provide structured feedback and scoring.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Architecture Design
• Built using FastAPI framework for high-performance async operations
• Implemented microservices architecture with separate evaluation pipeline
• Used PostgreSQL for persistent data storage and Redis for caching
• Integrated OpenAI GPT-4 API for intelligent text analysis and evaluation

Key Components:
1. File Upload Service - Handles PDF, DOCX, and text file processing
2. Document Processor - Extracts and normalizes text from various formats
3. AI Evaluation Pipeline - Multi-step process for comprehensive assessment
4. Background Task Manager - Async processing for non-blocking operations
5. Vector Database - RAG implementation for context-aware evaluations

Core Features Implemented:
• Multi-format document upload (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
• Structured CV data extraction using AI prompts
• Job requirement matching with scoring algorithms
• Project deliverable evaluation against standardized rubrics
• Real-time status tracking with WebSocket notifications
• Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
